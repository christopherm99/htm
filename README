htm -- hyper text mux.

A super simple HTTP multiplexer (ie. reverse proxy).

Usage:

  htm [-config <config_file>] [-port <port>]

Configuration:

Each non-empty, non-comment line should have a space separated list of items.
The first item should be the target URL, and the subsequent items should be
the hostnames you would like to proxy to this target URL. Note that
subdomains of the hosts will be matched, in order of specificity (ie.
a.b.c.com will match to a rule for b.c.com, even if a rule for c.com exists).
Advanced features include protocol rewrites and subdirectory specification.
See example.conf.
